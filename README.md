# SQL Challenges with PostgreSQL
This project focuses on addressing beginner and intermediate SQL challenges using PostgreSQL. By working with a **music** dataset, I solved various problems that helped deepen my understanding of SQL concepts and their real-world applications. This is just a project for learning purpose postgresql.

# Project Overview
In this project, I tackled a range of SQL queries, from basic data retrieval to more advanced and intermediate topics, such as:

Joins: Combining data from multiple tables.

Aggregations: Summarizing data using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG.

Subqueries: Using queries inside other queries to get desired results.

Window Functions: For more advanced data analysis.

# Key Features

Solving beginner and intermediate SQL challenges.
Using PostgreSQL to query and manipulate a music dataset.
Hands-on practice with intermediate SQL queries to solve real-world problems.
